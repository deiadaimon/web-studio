# WebStudio

Web Studio is an example of a simple yet effective **landing page**. It is an
**adaptive website** developed to provide an optimal experience across all major
device types: smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

The codebase adheres strictly to **HTML5** and **CSS3** standards, prioritizing **semantic markup** and passing code validation with zero errors or warnings. The architecture follows  **Concentric CSS** methodology, ensuring the stylesheets are highly organized, maintainable, and scalable. By leveraging **CSS Custom Properties** (variables) for design tokens and [modern-normalize](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/modern-normalize), the project maintains a consistent visual identity and flawless cross-browser performance.

Beyond clean code, the site is fine-tuned for **search engine compatibility** and improved **accessibility**, featuring performance-optimized, **high-resolution images** adapted for Retina displays.
